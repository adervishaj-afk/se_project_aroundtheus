**Intro**

Sprint #3 Around the U.S is the third project at Tripleten focusing on responsive wed design by applying relative units and grid rules. Relative units are measurements that change and are not fixed as in the case of pixels. The grid rules are another feature of the display rule that allow for more flexibility and responsiveness to layout for websites across different device screen sizes.

In addition, web queries were another tool used to redefine rules for classes in CSS depeding on the screen size they are displayed on. Lastly, we learned how to link url's for desired fonts from a vendor source and realtively linked the files for access to custom fonts.
